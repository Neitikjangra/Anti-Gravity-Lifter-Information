# Anti-Gravity Lifter: Electrostatic Propulsion Using High Voltage

## 🌀 Introduction

The **Anti-Gravity Lifter** is an experimental device leveraging the **Biefeld-Brown effect** to achieve lift through electrohydrodynamic (EHD) propulsion. By creating a strong electric field using high-voltage DC (~30kV), the lifter ionizes air molecules to produce an upward thrust. This lightweight and innovative design demonstrates the potential for silent, efficient propulsion in various applications, including drones and alternative aircraft.


## ⚙️ Features

- **High-Voltage Propulsion**: Achieves lift through electrostatic forces.
- **Lightweight Construction**: Built with materials like balsa wood and aluminum foil.
- **Enhanced Stability**: Stabilized with cables to prevent random movement or short-circuiting.
- **Efficient Power Circuitry**: Optimized for high-frequency, high-voltage generation.



## 🧩 Working Principle

1. A **high-voltage DC source** (~30kV) creates a powerful electric field.
2. The field ionizes surrounding air molecules, producing charged particles.
3. Accelerated particles collide with neutral air molecules, generating thrust.
4. This thrust force lifts the lightweight structure into the air.

The process exemplifies the **Biefeld-Brown effect**, transforming electrostatics into mechanical propulsion.
